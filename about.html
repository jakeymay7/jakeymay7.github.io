<p>Who: Don’t worry about it. Seriously, let’s get this off the ground before I attach my name to this potential dumpster fire of a blog.</p>

<p>What: You have stumbled upon a music review blog, albeit one that focuses primarily on hip-hop and R&B music because those are the genres from which I derive the most pleasure. Still, don’t be surprised by the occasional foray into television, movies, or other aspects of contemporary culture that I develop a strong opinion about.</p>

<p>Where: Here on your computer/smartphone, brought to you by the wonderful people at WordPress. Expansion to other mediums will be addressed here first (if we get that far).</p>

<p>When: Ideally once a day, but don’t hold me to it.</p>

<p>Why: See “The Grand Scheme” for more.</p>
