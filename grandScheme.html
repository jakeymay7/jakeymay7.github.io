	Hello friends, and welcome to The Pulpit. I won’t pretend that this has been a dream of mine or many years in the making or something like that; I came up with the concept for this site while enjoying the melodic drone of my roommate’s snores in the wee hours of the morning. That being said, my mind has feebly churning out ideas for the site all day, and I am genuinely excited to get started.
</p>
<p>
	I am blessed and lucky enough to currently be enrolled at an American university, and a pretty good one according to the people at Forbes (if you take stock in those things). A slightly uncomfortable truth that I have encountered is that many of the people here are far more creative and talented than I am, and are deeply engaged in personal projects or lifelong dreams while I vegetate in my room and ride a Penny skateboard back and forth across the floor from the door to the far wall. So, here is where I make my stand against my lack of talent: I’m starting this blog.
</p>
<p>
	Two things I’ve always enjoyed are music and writing; music because there is a song for literally every mood and situation imaginable, and writing because it isn’t math or science. I would write in a similar capacity for, perhaps, a campus publication, but music is such a personal matter that granting creative control of my content to someone else would be pointless. Besides, my father taught me lots of bad words that I couldn’t use at a more formal publication but can use here (but don’t worry, they will the seasoning rather than the main course).
</p>
<p>
	I have been an informed fan of hip-hop music since sophomore year in high school, when a concerned friend introduced me to the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, and The Notorious B.I.G after he noticed I had half of Soulja Boy’s seminal major-label debut&nbsp;<i>souljaboytelli.com&nbsp;</i>on my phone. I’ve been a voracious consumer of that genre since, and have expanded my tastes to include R&amp;B and some genres of EDM that I won’t try to name because someone will get mad when I use the wrong terminology. Old school, new school, whatever the mid-2000s was, I’ll listen to it all. Keep in mind I was born in 1997, so I don’t remember where I was when anything happened before 2004.
</p>
<p>
	The reason I’m choosing to tackle music reviews is because I absolutely hate reading music reviews. They are long (I realize this too is long, the rest will be shorter), they are boring, and it almost feels like the reviewer is talking down to you, as if you wouldn’t have thought the thoughts you are thinking about the music if you hadn’t read that particular review. None of that here. I hope to capture the raw feeling of listening to a good piece of music without forcing you to wade through complex language or rhetoric. A former English teacher of mine once told me not to say in 10 words what you can say in five, and I hope to bring that to the table here.
</p>
<p>
	I also hope to shine a light on music that you might not have found otherwise. The way I look at it, there is nothing I could say about the artistic value of, for example, <i>Illmatic</i>&nbsp;that hasn’t been said already (if you don’t get the reference, you probably won’t enjoy this site). I will try to cover music that doesn’t get the shine it deserves. That doesn’t mean I plan on avoiding more mainstream music totally, but I’ll only blog about a song or album if I found it exciting or unique (or particularly horrible); there’s too much average music out there to cover it all. Ideally, I will broaden your musical horizons and give you a few laughs along the way.

	The lectern is for the readings, but the pulpit is for the sermon (church reference for you heathens out there). Let’s go.
