<p>Wasiu is one to keep an eye on. He hails from the relatively unacknowledged, non-Toronto portion of Canada, specifically Montreal. <em>MTLiens 2 </em>came out at the end of October, and it serves in part as a tribute to the considerable hip-hop talent in Montreal. Wasiu, raised in Montreal by a Haitian mother and a Nigerian father, is the ringleader from start to finish on his latest release but still saves space for his fellow Mtliens. Wasiu is by no means a household name; the best interview I found with him was done by Fox Sports (worth a read if you liked the project).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you were in a rush and wanted to distill <em>MTLiens 2</em> down into one song (listen to the whole thing instead), that song would be &ldquo;BMW (Bus Metro Walk).&rdquo; The track is a nice sampler of elements found elsewhere on the album, most notably the electronic-tinged production. Buzzing synths serve as the backdrop for a snappy, jerky bass/drum combo punctuated by futuristic beeps. Songs like &ldquo;Daddy Issues&rdquo; and &ldquo;Angry Black Man&rdquo; employ that same formula of hammering bass lines and futuristic, glitchy synths to create palatable, but highly listenable, tracks. &ldquo;Daddy Issues&rdquo; is an album standout, as Wasiu takes us to the strip club only to experience a moral dilemma, a contrast to the rather pleasant, lively beat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On &ldquo;BMW,&rdquo; you will also find Wasiu rapping matter-of-factly to a young lady with whom he&rsquo;d like to spend some time. These locked-in but lighthearted bars strike a balance between the two mic presences Wasiu seems to bring to the table. The falsetto raps found on songs such as &ldquo;Sunday Mourning,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Odyssey&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Dep&rdquo; tend to deal more with females, and they are a pleasant blend of steady raps and shifting pitches. By contrast, songs such as &ldquo;7D Joint,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cigarettes and Poutine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tabula Rasa&rdquo; display Wasiu&rsquo;s mic skills, as he ups the intensity and goes in on a variety of topics from the ugly realities of his daily life to self-doubt to just having fun lyrically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only tape element &ldquo;BMW&rdquo; lacks is the crew aspect. <em>MTLiens 2 </em>features two cypher tracks with &ldquo;Artbeat Cypher&rdquo; and &ldquo;Loi 101.&rdquo; The track narration explains the significance behind Artbeat Montreal and how Montreal artists congregate there to collaborate. Both tracks feature solid cypher beats that strike the balance between sonically interesting and unassuming enough to let the rapping take center stage. The consistency of the featured artists, top to bottom, is impressive and speaks to the deep pool of talent in Montreal. The French-speaking roots of Quebec appear mostly on these cyphers, with Wasiu featuring who he calls, &ldquo;Franglish/Frenglish/French rappers.&rdquo; Hearing French on a hip-hop track was certainly a new experience for me, and quite a pleasant change of pace at that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>MTLiens 2</em> is an oddball release created by artists with chips on their shoulders and the desire to make their sound go mainstream. Elements of jazz, hip-hop, and EDM are featured in equal measure, and it&rsquo;s that blend of influences that makes the project unique but highly listenable. There are no skips or duds to be found, and the cohesiveness only enhances the listening experience. Wasiu is a better rapper than singer, but it never feels like he&rsquo;s trying too hard at either. His low-register raps and vocals mesh well with the funky production and never come off as harsh or grating. Pulling together an entire musical community is an impressive feat, and Wasiu deserves a lot of credit. <em>MTLiens 2</em> is a big triumph and should move Montreal towards the breakout it deserves.</p>
