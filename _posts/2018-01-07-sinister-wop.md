<p class="p1">Lil Wop is, obviously, a Gucci Mane stan. However, most superfans don&rsquo;t end up signing to their idol&rsquo;s label or collaborating with said idol. There&rsquo;s plenty of information out there on the connections between Wop and the original Gucci, but for now the focus is the prot&eacute;g&eacute;'s latest offering, <em>Wopaveli 3</em>. The tape is uneven, but there are some standout tracks, mostly in the mold of my personal highlight, &ldquo;Sinister.&rdquo; Lil Wop has a distinct voice&ndash;a dry, grating croak that becomes tolerable when paired with dark, swirling production. That&rsquo;s exactly what Wop gets on &ldquo;Sinister,&rdquo; and he goes to work over a hammering bass line and distorted, bell-esque synths. He&rsquo;s not blowing anyone away thematically or lyrically, but solid production and a unique vocal range prove to be an effective combination. Wop appears to be heading in this directions stylistically, so those who like &ldquo;Sinister&rdquo; will want to keep an eye on his 2018 releases.</p>
