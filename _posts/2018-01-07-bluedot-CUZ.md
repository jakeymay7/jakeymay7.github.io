<p class="p1">CUZ Lightyear is not a name I&rsquo;m intimately familiar with; <em>WHAT UP CUZ</em>, released back in late September, was the first I&rsquo;d heard of the rapper formerly known as SL Jones. According to Wikipedia, Lightyear was born in Flint, raised in Arkansas, and moved to Atlanta to pursue music. A tour with Killer Mike preceded his latest mixtape, highlighted by its first three tracks. &ldquo;Blue Dot&rdquo; is my favorite of the three, bringing quick 808s and some staticky synths to pair with Lightyear&rsquo;s low-register, skillful bars detailing his trap lifestyle to create a futuristic song easily thrown on repeat. The song is solid on its own, and the tape is a good introduction to Lightyear. Here&rsquo;s to hoping he has more like this on the way in 2018.</p>
